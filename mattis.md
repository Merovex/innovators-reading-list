Just attended a talk/Q&A General [Mattis], CENTCOM commander at my employer's. He spoke about junior leadership, which was a rather fun conversation. I tried to distill a fewof his points and wanted to share them with you. As always, best to read my files in Courier New, 10pt. And, 1 person plural refers to my company when in all caps. You can see Boyd's philosophy had worked its magic on the Marines' philosophy.

The one principle that has had the greatest impact on his 38-year career: Improvise. Improvise. Improvise.



His Story
========



1. LTC (18 yrs) Gulf War

2. Pre-9/11, was given a dead-end assignment because of "bad behavior."

3. Went into Fallugah, etc.

4. Officer group called "jedi knights" I need to recall 


Trust
======


1. Trust is the Coin of the Realm. Without trust, your leadership is obsolete.

2. If you are unable to be persuaded, then you do not deserve to lead.

3. Listen to Mavericks.

4. Leaders should allow adverse (adversarial) viewpoints but bring harmony.

5. (OUR) organization will break your heart at some point in your career. It's not there to be your friend. It will win your respect.

6. When stressed, you will return to your real self... you will try to surround yourself with like-minded people. Resist that. Train yourself to be what you want to be under stress.

7. Do not kill initiative, build and maintain trust.



Strategic Thinking
==================


1. Senior leadership is about strategic thinking. He said he sees few strategic leaders at his level (he's talking Generals across the military here).

2. He believes strategic thinking is more inate in the U.S. due to crappy (his word) education. 

3. U.K. officers use 10 adjectives where a U.S. officer uses three in the same paragraph...his observation is that a broad vocabulary suggest a broad perspective. 

4. He believes U.K. educational system (at least for the officer cadre) is more conducive to strategic thinking.

5. Formal U.S. strategic education weeds out original thought...if a graduate expresses an original thought it will be the first (only) time since completing a strategy school (he's talking senior service schools as well as Harvard education).

6. Strategy involves (said he's not seen any strategy in IZ or AF in the past 9 years):
   
    1. Interest to be defended, extended.
   
    2. The Ends we seek.
   
    3. The Policy that governs our behavior.
   
    4. The Means to reach the ends.

7. If we lack the Means, change the Ends.



Self-Education
==============


1. Be curious. Read widely, outside your domain (harkens to a book I have on Leadership Intelligence).

2. Do disciplined research, but an unconventional approach

3. Avoid surprises by being curious.

4. Do gap analysis

5. He likes Marcus Aurelius as his favorite great leader, if he had to chose one; then Mendella, Lincoln, Sherman, etc. He takes a little from all great leaders.



Culture
=======


1. "Irrevocable world view" is what the Muslims have.

2. Are the outcomes of the Enlightenment worth defending? If so, we need to. Enlightement includes the concept of tolerance of different thought. We need to be intolerant about defending tolerance.

3. The military will hold the line, but only if WE can keep them informed.

4. They are committed and unapologetic about their world view...we need to be, too. (See point 2)

5. Avoid "Dramatic Instance fallacy," which he defines differently than you find online. He said a dramatic event in your life will create a vividness that will lead to bias which in turn becomes racism (he was talking combat). Kill racism, relieve officers who are smitten with it.

6. "Be unapologetic about your opinion and culture.




Leadership
==========


1. It is more like coaching than commanding (Coaching > Commanding)

2. Give Commander's Intent (my phrase), and few orders---train your subordinates well and trust them to carry your orders out. (Give directions, then shut up)

3. He said in one battle that spanned a week he gave only two orders...

4. Mother Teresa shook his hand once and said, "Can you do more?" He thought, `I guess I could.'

5. Give your intent, the mission over an order, and let them execute---they won't do it your way but they'll get your result. This is not benign neglect.

6. We are the Varsity Team. Stop acting like Junior Varsity.

7. We (leaders) are not on the sidelines. We are in the thick of action. You're going to make mistakes and get bloody. Get over it.



Cynism
======

1. Do not accept cynicism or pessimists. If they are enlisted, let the Gunny handle them in his own way. If they are officers, relieve them.

2. Cynics try to breed despair and powerlessness...irrepressible

3. Junior leaders need to be a shock absorber against Cynisim



As a Junior Leader
==================


1. Earn confidence

2. Stop an order early and get the (Commander's Intent) and ask for latitude to acheive the intent.

3. Lead up. (My summation of his points on junior leadership)



Current Events & War of Words & Press
====================================

1. We are losing the narrative figbht because we do not trust our youth or differing thoughts.

2. Bombs: when terrorists detonate a bomb in IZ killing/wounding 80 it is "a bomb went off." When we accidentally bomb a wedding party killing 20 its "The Americans bombed a wedding party." What is it active when we make a mistake, and passive when they are intentional?

3. A journalist said he received phone calls every couple of hours from a terrorist he knew would behead him if he could. That terrorist told him what was happening, who did it and why (it was NATO's fault). The same journalist calls his (U.K.) government on a Friday afternoon and 1) may not get a call back, 2) if he does it's a public affairs guy 3) who doesn't know anything and 4) will say no comment when he does.

4. It's not always the media's fault; some of them are honest but are not given straight answers. They go with what they have.

5. "We have a mendacious press."



Combat & Orders
===============


1. Early in AF, there was contact on one side...Brigadiers with a pistol are useless in a firefight...so we went to the other side to ensure the Marines were focused. One (who was to leave the Corps soon) said, "I hope they come to our side. This is a perfect war. They want to die, and we want to kill them."

2. "Taking the Fun out of Fundamentalism"

3. Why is it we give an OPORDER followed by an Info annex? We're in an information war. We need to be giving information followed by a command annex.
